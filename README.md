Improving Customer Retention with Machine Learning and Deep Learning-Based Churn Prediction

### Step 1: Data Preparation and Environment Setup
- Import necessary modules and set up the environment.
- Define general functions for data preprocessing and feature engineering.

### Step 2: Data Inspection and Summary Statistics
- Inspect the data to understand its structure, variables, and initial quality.
- Calculate and present summary statistics for the dataset.

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing
- Perform data preprocessing, including type conversion, handling duplicates, processing null values, dropping redundant columns, and outlier analysis.
- Process data to ensure its readiness for modeling.

### Step 4: Feature Engineering
- Conduct feature engineering, scaling the data, and encoding categorical variables for improved model performance.

### Step 5: Model Building
- Define a set of models for model selection, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, a Voting Classifier ensemble, and Neural Networks.
- Train traditional models using conventional training techniques.
- Train neural network models using the `fit` method and "fit one cycle" technique for better optimization and convergence.

### Step 6: Model Optimization
- Optimize the top two performing models for improved accuracy and efficiency.

### Step 7: Feature Selection
- Utilize the SelectKBest method for feature selection, enhancing model performance by focusing on relevant features.

### Step 8: Model Evaluation and Deployment
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Choose the best-performing model and deploy it for use in the desired application.
